# stars_planets_cli

Welcome to my very first CLI app! It is a search application that uses an API from the NASA Exoplanet Archive to access data on planets and stars.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository by copying the following into your terminal:
  
    >*git clone [git@github.com:Alex3921/stars_planets_cli.git](git@github.com:Alex3921/stars_planets_cli.git)*
  
2. Run 'bundle install' to install all necessary gems the application is dependent on. 

    >*bundle install*
        
3. Lastly, to start the application run the following:

    >*ruby bin/run*

## Usage

Once the application starts you just need to follow the on-screen propts. Have fun!
